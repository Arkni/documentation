## Installing Kuzzle on Windows and Mac OS (via Docker)

The most efficient way to install Kuzzle on Windows or Mac OS is via **Docker**. This is done pretty much the same way as described in the [previous section](#installing-kuzzle-via-docker).

* Follow these instructions to install [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/).
* Follow these instructions to install [Docker for Mac OS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/).

Now that Docker is working, you can install Kuzzle just as described in the [previous section](#installing-kuzzle-via-docker).
