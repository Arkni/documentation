## Installing Kuzzle on Windows and Mac OS (via Docker)

Even though we don't provide support for these OSes you can install Kuzzle on those for development purposes.  
The most efficient way to install Kuzzle on Windows or Mac OS is via **Docker**. This is done pretty much the same way as described in the [previous section](#installing-kuzzle-via-docker).

* Follow these instructions to install [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/).
* Follow these instructions to install [Docker for Mac OS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/).

Now that Docker is working, you can install Kuzzle just as described in the [previous section](#installing-kuzzle-via-docker).
