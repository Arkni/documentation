## The Plugin System

Being able to grab a full-feature backend and run it quickly is very convenient, but Kuzzle is about more than that. As soon as you start developing real-life applications that live out in the wild, you need to **extend your backend with your own business-logic**.
That's quite legitimate: some logic is sensible and cannot live on the client.

For example, imagine your application needs to leverage a **third-party payment system**, such as Braintree. You don't want to put the client in charge of bearing API keys and tokens. Also, you will probably want to **keep track of orders** and payments, once the transactions successfully end. This should be also a concern of your backend. Also, you are not likely to allow your customers to purchase more items than available, right? At some point, **your backend has to validate the transaction** by comparing the ordered quantity with the available stocks.

To solve this problem, Kuzzle ships with a powerful **[Plugin System](/plugin-reference)** that enables you to add features to your server in a modular fashion. With Kuzzle Plugins you can

* use an existing plugin from the Kuzzle Plugins ecosystem (such as the [OAuth2 Authentication strategy](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle-plugin-auth-passport-oauth) or the [MQTT Protocol](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle-plugin-mqtt));
* [create your own plugin](/plugin-reference/#writing-plugin-code) from scratch.

### Plugin Types

There are three main Plugin types, each one has specific features.

#### Core Plugins

They are the most common type of plugins and are meant to extend the Kuzzle Core features. They are plugged on the Kuzzle Core at startup and execute on its same thread. A Core Plugin can extend Kuzzle with the following features:

[Listen asynchronously](/plugin-reference#listener-plugins), and perform operations that depend on data-related events. The chunk of data involved with the event is passed to the triggered callback, but the Kuzzle Core continues its execution without waiting for the callback to return, nor receiving the return value of the callback.

  _Example - "Write a log to a third-party log system every time a document is deleted"_. The [Logger Plugin](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle-plugin-logger), shipped with Kuzzle, uses this feature to log all the data-related events.

[Listen synchronously](/plugin-reference#pipe-plugins), and perform operations that depend on data-related events. many synchronous listeners can be chained, forming a pipeline. The chunk of data involved with the event is passed to the plugin pipeline and can be modified. The Kuzzle Core waits for the pipeline to return and receives the returned value (which must be the processed chunk of data). The pipeline can even stop a request life-cycle, returning a standard Error to the Kuzzle Core.

  _Example - "Compare the ordered quantity with the available stocks and return an error if ordered is greater than stocks"_.

[Add a controller route](/plugin-reference#controllers) to expose new actions to the API.

  _Example - "Expose a `checkout` API endpoint that handles the Braintree payment process"_.

[Add an authentication strategy](/plugin-reference#authentication-plugin) the User authentication system.

  _Example - "Enable Kuzzle to authenticate users via the OAuth strategy"_
  Kuzzle ships with an Authentication Plugin already bundled in its Community Edition, the [Local Strategy Plugin](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle-plugin-auth-passport-local).

#### Worker Plugins
[Workers Plugins](/plugin-reference#worker-plugins) are Core Plugins that run on a separate process. The only feature they can add is to [asynchronously listen to data-related events](/plugin-reference#listener-plugins). They are useful when performing costly operations as they have no impact on Kuzzle performances.

_Example - "Compute a complex data-mining operation and commit the result to a third-party Business-Intelligence platform every time a document is changed"._

#### Protocol Plugins
[Protocol Plugins](/plugin-reference#protocol-plugins) extend Kuzzle networking capabilities by adding new network protocols.

_Example - "Enable Kuzzle to interact with XMPP-oriented services"_
Kuzzle ships with a Protocol Plugin already bundled in its Community Edition, the [Websocket Plugin](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle-plugin-websocket).

### Examples

This example is a very dummy one. We are going to install the **Hello World Controller Plugin**, which opens a new API endpoint that simply... Greets the client! Not very useful, except for the sake of this example.

To install a Plugin, you just need to make it accessible within the `plugins/enabled` directory (relative to the path of the Kuzzle installation directory). A common practice is to copy the Plugin code in `plugins/available` and create a symbolic link in `plugins/enabled` pointing to it. This way, enabling and disabling a plugin is just a matter of creating or deleting a symbolic link.

<aside class="notice">
If you are running Kuzzle in a Docker container, you will need to enter the container to access the installation directory.
</aside>

Go to the Kuzzle installation directory and type:

```bash
$ cd plugins/available
$ git clone https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle-plugin-helloworld.git
$ cd ../enabled
$ ln -s ../available/kuzzle-plugin-helloworld .
$ pm2 restart KuzzleServer
```

Once Kuzzle has restarted (that's what the last command is for) you can check the server information at `http://localhost:7511/?pretty=true` for the new `hello` endpoint:

```json
{
    ...
    "result": {
        "serverInfo": {
            "kuzzle": {
                ...
                "api": {
                    "routes":
                    ...
                    "kuzzle-plugin-helloworld/hello": {
                      "sayHello": {
                        "name": "sayHello"
                      }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

Which means you can call the `http://localhost:7511/kuzzle-plugin-helloworld/hello/` route and get the following response:

```json
{
  "requestId": "66265614-e908-4a91-a492-135e40e64aa3",
  "status": 200,
  "error": null,
  "controller": "kuzzle-plugin-helloworld/hello",
  "action": "sayHello",
  "collection": null,
  "index": null,
  "metadata": null,
  "result": "Hello world"
}
```

### Managing Plugins

As seen in the previous example, managing Plugins is really just a matter of moving files and symbolic links around.

#### Installing, removing, enabling and disabling Plugins

When starting, Kuzzle (both Core and Proxy) looks for Plugins in the `plugins/enabled` directory. Valid Plugins are well-formed NPM modules (i.e. they have a `package.json` at their root) or simple NodeJS requireables (i.e. they have at their root a valid `index.js`).

A common practice is to copy the Plugin code in `plugins/available` and create a symbolic link in `plugins/enabled` pointing to it. This way, enabling and disabling a plugin is just a matter of creating or deleting a symbolic link.

#### Configuring Plugins

When initializing a Plugin, Kuzzle calls its `init(customConfig, context)` method, passing the [context](/plugin-reference/#the-plugin-context) and the custom configuration. Custom configuration parameters are specified for each plugin in the `plugins` object of the [Kuzzle configuration file](#configuring-kuzzle).

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "kuzzle-plugin-foobar": {
      "option_1": "option_value",
      "option_2": "option_value"
    }
  }
}
```

Each Plugin is responsible of handling the custom configuration parameters and Kuzzle has no opinion on how to do it. Whether the custom configuration is merged with the defaults or not entirely depends on the implementation of the `init` function.
