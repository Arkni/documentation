## Working with persistent data

Kuzzle relies on [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) to store and fetch persistent data.

In Kuzzle, data is organized in the following way:

* **Documents** are the atomic unit of data. They are defined as JSON structures, in the classical NoSQL fashion and are identified by a unique `_id`.
* Documents are grouped into **Collections**, identified by a unique name.
* Collections are grouped into **Indexes**, identified by a unique name.

### Document CRUD

Kuzzle ships with a full data [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) API that enables you to operate in many ways on your documents.

Let's [**create a new document**](/api-reference/#create48), for example, in `mycollection`, within `myindex` via the HTTP protocol. This is done by sending a `POST` request to the API endpoint `http://localhost:7512/myindex/mycollection/_create` with the body set to

```json
{
  "message": "Hello, world!"
}
```

Notice that the document is associated to the auto-generated id `AVkDBl3YsT6qHI7MxLz0`, as we can see in the response:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "error": null,
  "requestId": "38d08fa9-449d-47f7-8593-dc136f8b3559",
  "controller": "document",
  "action": "create",
  "collection": "mycollection",
  "index": "myindex",
  "metadata": null,
  "headers": {},
  "result": {
    "_index": "myindex",
    "_type": "mycollection",
    "_id": "AVkDBl3YsT6qHI7MxLz0",
    "_version": 1,
    "result": "created",
    "_shards": {
      "total": 2,
      "successful": 1,
      "failed": 0
    },
    "created": true,
    "_source": {
      "message": "Hello, world!",
      "_kuzzle_info": {
        "author": "-1",
        "createdAt": 1481814465050,
        "updatedAt": null,
        "updater": null,
        "active": true,
        "deletedAt": null
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Take some time to examine the content of a [Kuzzle Response](#kuzzle-response-objects). You may notice that it contains useful information like the name of the [controller and action](/#core-architecture) that correspond to the HTTP route we hit with our request, or the complete KuzzleDocument object we just created.

One more thing you may notice is that `myindex` and `mycollection` are created on-the-fly along with the document. Let's verify it by [**getting the list of collections**](/api-reference/?http#list) stored in `myindex` by sending a `GET` request to `http://localhost:7512/myindex/_list`.

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "error": null,
  "requestId": "51b276c3-3698-4412-b3dc-80d0f84541fb",
  "controller": "collection",
  "action": "list",
  "collection": null,
  "index": "myindex",
  "metadata": null,
  "headers": {},
  "result": {
    "collections": [
      {
        "name": "mycollection",
        "type": "stored"
      }
    ],
    "type": "all"
  }
}
```

Take a look at the `result` field in the Response from Kuzzle. It contains an array of `collections`, each one defined by a `name` and a `type`. `mycollection` is of type `stored` (which stands for persistent). This is made to distinguish persisted collection from the `realtime` (or volatile) collections, used to identify [real-time documents](#realtime-notifications).

Let's [**modify to our brand new document**](/api-reference/?http#update) by sending a `PUT` request to `http://localhost:7512/myindex/mycollection/AVkDBl3YsT6qHI7MxLz0/_update` with the body set to:

```json
{
  "message": "in a bottle",
  "an_englishman": "in New York"
}
```

Which gives us the response...

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "error": null,
  "requestId": "6241ec4d-8529-43ba-9b77-3028b99cd621",
  "controller": "document",
  "action": "update",
  "collection": "mycollection",
  "index": "myindex",
  "metadata": null,
  "headers": {},
  "result": {
    "_index": "myindex",
    "_type": "mycollection",
    "_id": "AVkDBl3YsT6qHI7MxLz0",
    "_version": 2,
    "result": "updated",
    "_shards": {
      "total": 2,
      "successful": 1,
      "failed": 0
    }
  }
}
```

...telling us that the document has been successfully updated.

Now, we'll let you figure out what happens when we send a `DELETE` request to `http://localhost:7512/myindex/mycollection/AVkDBl3YsT6qHI7MxLz0` with an empty body (take a look at the [API Reference](/api-reference/?http#delete) if you don't want to try).

### Document Search

One thing that Elasticsearch is _really_ good at doing is... Searching! It enables to create extremely precise search queries, thanks to its powerful query DSL. We wrote a [comprehensive cookbook](#elasticsearch-cookbook) to help you understand how it works in detail, but let's take a look at a couple of simple examples, just to get started.

Say we want to [**find**](/api-reference/?http#search) all the documents within `mycollection`, via the HTTP protocol. To do it, we send a `POST` request to `http://localhost:7512/myindex/mycollection/_search` (we leave the body empty since we have no filters to apply to our query). Depending on the documents you have created in your database, the response will look like:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "error": null,
  "requestId": "3b486d49-f1f9-4595-8c10-b63cc5fc1279",
  "controller": "document",
  "action": "search",
  "collection": "mycollection",
  "index": "myindex",
  "metadata": null,
  "headers": {},
  "result": {
    "took": 69,
    "timed_out": false,
    "_shards": {
      "total": 5,
      "successful": 5,
      "failed": 0
    },
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": "myindex",
        "_type": "mycollection",
        "_id": "AVkDLAdCsT6qHI7MxLz4",
        "_score": 0,
        "_source": {
          "message": "Hey! Ho!"
        },
        "_kuzzle_info": {
          "author": "-1",
          "createdAt": 1481816934209,
          "updatedAt": null,
          "updater": null,
          "active": true,
          "deletedAt": null
        }
      },
      {
        "_index": "myindex",
        "_type": "mycollection",
        "_id": "AVkDK9iNsT6qHI7MxLz3",
        "_score": 0,
        "_source": {
          "message": "Hello, world!"
        },
        "_kuzzle_info": {
          "author": "-1",
          "createdAt": 1481816922252,
          "updatedAt": null,
          "updater": null,
          "active": true,
          "deletedAt": null
        }
      },
      {
        "_index": "myindex",
        "_type": "mycollection",
        "_id": "AVkDLCdRsT6qHI7MxLz5",
        "_score": 0,
        "_source": {
          "message": "Let's go!"
        },
        "_kuzzle_info": {
          "author": "-1",
          "createdAt": 1481816942415,
          "updatedAt": null,
          "updater": null,
          "active": true,
          "deletedAt": null
        }
      }
    ],
    "total": 3,
    "max_score": 0
  }
}
```

Looks neat. Say that now we only want to **query** the documents containing the word `Hey` in the `message` field. We can achieve this by adding the following query to our body:

```json
{
  "query": {
      "match": {
          "message":"Hey"
      }
    }
}
```

Which gives, as a result, the following response:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "error": null,
  "requestId": "e00cf6d6-8983-498b-8481-96a1fe1b5d46",
  "controller": "document",
  "action": "search",
  "collection": "mycollection",
  "index": "myindex",
  "metadata": null,
  "headers": {},
  "result": {
    "took": 6,
    "timed_out": false,
    "_shards": {
      "total": 5,
      "successful": 5,
      "failed": 0
    },
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": "myindex",
        "_type": "mycollection",
        "_id": "AVkDLAdCsT6qHI7MxLz4",
        "_score": 0.25811607,
        "_source": {
          "message": "Hey! Ho!"
        },
        "_kuzzle_info": {
          "author": "-1",
          "createdAt": 1481816934209,
          "updatedAt": null,
          "updater": null,
          "active": true,
          "deletedAt": null
        }
      }
    ],
    "total": 1,
    "max_score": 0.25811607
  }
}
```
