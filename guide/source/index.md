# Introduction

Kuzzle is a ready-to-use, **on-premises backend** that enables you to manage your persistent data and be notified in real-time on whatever happens to it. It also provides you with a flexible and powerful user-management system.

Kuzzle enables you to build modern web applications and complex IoT networks in no time.

* **Persisted data**: store your data and perform advanced searches on it.
* **Real-time notifications**: subscribe to fine-grained subsets of data.
* **User Management**: login, logout and security rules are no more a burden.
* **Extensible**: fit Kuzzle to your needs by leveraging the plugin system.
